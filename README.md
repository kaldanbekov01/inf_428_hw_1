# Homework 1 Progress Report

This file documents my daily progress on Homework 1 as part of a simulated work environment with daily stand-ups.

Day 1: 
Set up the GitHub repository: inf_428_hw_1.
Created the README.md file to document progress and provide explanations.
Solved 3 LeetCode tasks and documented my thought process and solutions in Miro.

Day 2:
Implemented the solution to calculate the aggregated user threat score.
The implementation involved normalizing threat scores from each department and applying weights based on department importance.
Aggregated the final score to ensure it remains within the original threat score range (0-90).
Created unit tests to verify the correctness of the function.

Day 3:
Started and completed the final task for feature transformation.
Wrote code and provided explanations for handling cyclic time features (to correctly handle time differences between different days).
Documented and commented the code thoroughly for clarity.
Pushed all final changes to the GitHub repository.
